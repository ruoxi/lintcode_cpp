The Smallest Difference

 Description
 Notes
 Testcase
 Judge
Given two array of integers(the first array is array A, the second array is array B), now we are going to find a element in array A which is A[i], and another element in array B which is B[j], so that the difference between A[i] and B[j] (|A[i] - B[j]|) is as small as possible, return their smallest difference.

Example
For example, given array A = [3,6,7,4], B = [2,8,9,3], return 0

//Runtime: O(min(n, m))
//Space: O(1)

class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param A, B: Two integer arrays.
     * @return: Their smallest difference.
     */
    int smallestDifference(vector<int> &A, vector<int> &B) {
        // write your code here
        
        if(A.empty() || B.empty()) return -1;
        
        int n = A.size();
        int m = B.size();
        
        sort(A.begin(), A.end());
        sort(B.begin(), B.end());
        
        int first = 0, second = 0;
        int res = INT_MAX;
        while(first < n && second < m)
        {
            if(A[first] < B[second])
            {
                res = min(res, B[second] - A[first]);
                first++;
            }
            else
            {
                res = min(res, A[first] - B[second]);
                second++;
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
