Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example
Given a binary tree as follow:

  1
 / \ 
2   3
   / \
  4   5
The maximum depth is 3.


* Definition of TreeNode:
 * class TreeNode {
 * public:
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left, *right;
 *     TreeNode(int val) {
 *         this->val = val;
 *         this->left = this->right = NULL;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param root: The root of binary tree.
     * @return: An integer
     */
    int maxDepth(TreeNode *root) {
        // write your code here
        if(root == NULL) return 0;
        
        int left = maxDepth(root->left);
        int right = maxDepth(root->right);
        
        return max(left, right)+1;
    }
};
