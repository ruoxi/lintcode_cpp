Lowest Common Ancestor
Given the root and two nodes in a Binary Tree. Find the lowest common ancestor(LCA) of the two nodes.

The lowest common ancestor is the node with largest depth which is the ancestor of both nodes.

 Notice

Assume two nodes are exist in tree.

Example
For the following binary tree:

  4
 / \
3   7
   / \
  5   6
LCA(3, 5) = 4

LCA(5, 6) = 7

LCA(6, 7) = 7
