Insert Node in a Binary Search Tree

 Description
 Notes
 Testcase
 Judge
Given a binary search tree and a new tree node, insert the node into the tree. You should keep the tree still be a valid binary search tree.

 Notice

You can assume there is no duplicate values in this tree + node.

Example
Given binary search tree as follow, after Insert node 6, the tree should be:

  2             2
 / \           / \
1   4   -->   1   4
   /             / \ 
  3             3   6
