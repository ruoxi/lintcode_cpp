There are n coins in a line. Two players take turns to take one or two coins from right side until there are no more coins left. The player who take the last coin wins.

Could you please decide the first play will win or lose?

Example
n = 1, return true.

n = 2, return true.

n = 3, return false.

n = 4, return true.

n = 5, return true.


class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param n: an integer
     * @return: a boolean which equals to true if the first player will win
     */
    //state: dp[i]表示还剩i个coin,第一个人是否能赢
     bool firstWillWin(int n) {
        // write your code here
        vector<bool> dp(n+1, false);
        
        dp[1] = true;
        dp[2] = true;
        dp[3] = false;
        
        for(int i = 4; i <=n; i++)
        {
            if(!dp[i-1] || !dp[i-2])
            {
                dp[i] = true;
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
};
